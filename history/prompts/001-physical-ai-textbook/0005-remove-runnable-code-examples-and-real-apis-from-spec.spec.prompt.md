## Prompt

```text
exclude it as we it is not our scope
```

## Response snapshot

```text
The spec `/mnt/d/speckKit-Hackathons/humanoid-robotic-book/specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md` has been successfully updated and re-validated. All items in the quality checklist passed.

📋 Architectural decision detected: Adjusting textbook scope regarding runnable code examples and real APIs. Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr "Adjusting textbook scope regarding runnable code examples and real APIs"`
```

## Outcome

- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Modified spec.md and requirements.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.adr`
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully updated the spec based on user's scope clarification, and highlighted the need for constitution update via ADR.
