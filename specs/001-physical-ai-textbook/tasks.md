# Tasks: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook



**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/



**Tests**: The feature specification does not explicitly request test tasks in the TDD approach, but independent tests are defined for each user story.



**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.



## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`



- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)

- Include exact file paths in descriptions



## Path Conventions



- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`

- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`

- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure



## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)



**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Docusaurus structure



- [ ] T001 Create Docusaurus project boilerplate in `/` (repository root) using `npx create-docusaurus@latest . classic --typescript`

- [ ] T002 Configure `docusaurus.config.js` for site metadata, GitHub Pages deployment settings, MDX, syntax highlighting, navbar/footer in `docusaurus.config.js`

- [ ] T003 [P] Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for GitHub Actions deployment

- [ ] T004 [P] Set up ESLint for MDX/JS/TS files (`.eslintrc.js`, `package.json`)

- [ ] T005 [P] Install `docusaurus-check-links` and configure for link validation (`package.json`, `docusaurus.config.js`)

- [ ] T006 Establish file naming conventions for folders and files in `docusaurus.config.js` and `docs/` structure



---



## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)



**Purpose**: Core Docusaurus content infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented



**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete



- [ ] T007 Create `docs/` and `static/img/` directories

- [ ] T008 Create `docs/glossary.md` with basic frontmatter and "Glossary Term" entities as per `data-model.md`

- [ ] T009 Create `docs/00-introduction/` directory and `docs/00-introduction/index.mdx` with frontmatter

- [ ] T010 Create `docs/01-quarter-overview/` directory and `docs/01-quarter-overview/index.mdx` with frontmatter



**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel



---



## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Read Textbook Content (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP



**Goal**: As a student, I want to easily navigate and read the textbook content, which is structured according to the Docusaurus folder hierarchy and sidebar navigation, so that I can learn about Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.



**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the deployed Docusaurus site, verifying the Docusaurus folder hierarchy and sidebar navigation, checking frontmatter standards for all pages, and browsing through all modules and chapters. Content readability and accessibility of diagrams and conceptual code blocks should also be verified.



### Implementation for User Story 1



- [ ] T011 [US1] Create `docs/02-module-1-ros2/` directory and `docs/02-module-1-ros2/index.mdx` with frontmatter

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create `docs/03-module-2-gazebo-unity/` directory and `docs/03-module-2-gazebo-unity/index.mdx` with frontmatter

- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create `docs/04-module-3-nvidia-isaac/` directory and `docs/04-module-3-nvidia-isaac/index.mdx` with frontmatter

- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Create `docs/05-module-4-vla/` directory and `docs/05-module-4-vla/index.mdx` with frontmatter

- [ ] T015 [P] [US1] Create `docs/06-capstone/` directory and `docs/06-capstone/index.mdx` with frontmatter

- [ ] T016 [US1] Configure `docusaurus.config.js` for sidebar generation strategy (`docs/sidebar.js` if custom, otherwise `autogenerated`)



**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently



---



## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Utilize Code Examples and Diagrams (Priority: P1)



**Goal**: As a student, I want to view and understand diagrams and conceptual code blocks within the textbook so that I can grasp practical applications of the concepts.



**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all embedded code blocks and diagrams render correctly and are readable.



### Implementation for User Story 2



- [ ] T017 [US2] Ensure MDX configuration supports Mermaid diagrams and conceptual code blocks in `docusaurus.config.js`

- [ ] T018 [US2] Add an example Mermaid diagram to a placeholder chapter in `docs/02-module-1-ros2/01-mermaid-example.mdx`

- [ ] T019 [US2] Add an example conceptual Python code block to a placeholder chapter in `docs/02-module-1-ros2/02-python-example.mdx`



**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently



---



## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Generate Module and Chapter Specifications (Priority: P1)



**Goal**: As a project architect/contributor, I want to generate the complete, accurate, and production-ready content for the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook, explicitly divided into 13 weeks of teaching material across the four modules, using the official Docusaurus structure and authoring standards.



**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all module-level and chapter-level content, explicitly organized into a 13-week breakdown, is generated according to the defined structure and content requirements, and that it integrates into a Docusaurus-aligned hierarchy.



### Implementation for User Story 3



- [ ] T020 [US3] Create a chapter content template (e.g., `.specify/templates/chapter-template.mdx`) including learning objectives, concepts, diagrams, tutorials, troubleshooting, exercises, and frontmatter.

- [ ] T021 [US3] Implement a workflow to generate MDX content from granular Spec-Kit specifications, adhering to the 13-week breakdown.




**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional



---



## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Adding chapter content inside each module folder (Priority: P1)



**Goal**: As a project contributor, I want to add specific chapter content within each module's Docusaurus folder, following the defined weekly breakdown, so that the textbook is systematically populated with educational material.



**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that each module directory (`02-module-1-ros2/`, `03-module-2-gazebo-unity/`, etc.) contains `.md` or `.mdx` files corresponding to the weekly breakdown, with correct frontmatter and content adhering to the "Mandatory Chapter Standards."



### Implementation for User Story 4



- [ ] T023 [US4] Create placeholder chapter files (e.g., `01-ros2-basics.mdx`, `02-ros2-nodes.mdx` for Weeks 3-5) within `docs/02-module-1-ros2/` with correct frontmatter and basic content.

- [ ] T024 [P] [US4] Create placeholder chapter files for Weeks 6-7 within `docs/03-module-2-gazebo-unity/` with correct frontmatter and basic content.

- [ ] T025 [P] [US4] Create placeholder chapter files for Weeks 8-10 within `docs/04-module-3-nvidia-isaac/` with correct frontmatter and basic content.

- [ ] T026 [P] [US4] Create placeholder chapter files for Weeks 11-12 within `docs/05-module-4-vla/` with correct frontmatter and basic content.

- [ ] T027 [P] [US4] Create placeholder chapter files for Week 13 Capstone within `docs/06-capstone/` with correct frontmatter and basic content.

- [ ] T028 [US4] Verify all chapter files across all modules have correct Docusaurus frontmatter and `sidebar_position` for proper navigation.



**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional



---



## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Build and Deploy Textbook (Priority: P1)



**Goal**: As a project contributor, I want to build the Docusaurus site and deploy it to GitHub Pages so that the textbook is accessible to users.



**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the build command locally and then deploying the site to a GitHub Pages environment, verifying successful deployment and public access.



### Implementation for User Story 5



- [ ] T029 [US5] Verify `npm install` and `npm start` commands locally for project setup and local development.

- [ ] T030 [US5] Verify `npm run build` command locally to ensure a successful static site generation.

- [ ] T031 [US5] Test the GitHub Actions deployment workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` by pushing a branch and observing deployment to GitHub Pages.



**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional



---



## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns



**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories or are project-wide



- [ ] T032 Review all generated content for technical accuracy, pedagogical clarity, and adherence to the "Zero Hallucination" principle.

- [ ] T033 Run `docusaurus-check-links` for a final comprehensive link validation across the entire site.

- [ ] T034 Ensure all acceptance criteria from `/specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/plan.md` are met.

- [ ] T035 Update `quickstart.md` with any necessary refinements to local setup and running instructions.

## Dependencies & Execution Order



### Phase Dependencies



- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories

- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion

  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)

  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P1 → P1)

- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete



### User Story Dependencies



- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 for content rendering, but independent in terms of diagram/code block strategy.

- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No direct dependencies on US1/US2 for its core content generation workflow.

- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for folder structure and US3 for content generation workflow.

- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on all other stories for content to build and deploy.



### Within Each User Story



- Implementation tasks generally follow a logical flow (e.g., directory creation before content population).

- Story complete before moving to next priority.



### Parallel Opportunities



- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel.

- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2).

- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows), though some have logical dependencies.

- Implementation tasks within a story marked [P] can run in parallel.

- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members, especially for content generation.



---



## Parallel Example: Content Generation (User Stories 3 & 4)



```bash

# After Foundational tasks are complete:



# Developer A works on generating content templates and workflow (US3):

Task: "Create a chapter content template"

Task: "Implement a workflow to generate MDX content from Spec-Kit specs"



# Developer B works on populating initial chapter files (US4, using templates/workflow from US3 once available):

Task: "Create placeholder chapter files for Weeks 3-5 within docs/02-module-1-ros2/"

Task: "Create placeholder chapter files for Weeks 6-7 within docs/03-module-2-gazebo-unity/"

```

## Implementation Strategy



### MVP First (User Story 1 Focus)



1. Complete Phase 1: Setup

2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)

3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1

4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently

5. Deploy/demo if ready



### Incremental Delivery



1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready

2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)

3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo

4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo

5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo

6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo

7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories



### Parallel Team Strategy



With multiple developers:



1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together

2. Once Foundational is done:

   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Navigation)

   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Diagrams/Code Blocks)

   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Content Generation Workflow)

   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Populating Chapter Content - using US3 workflow)

   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Build & Deploy)

3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes



- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies

- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability

- Each user story should be independently completable and testable

- Commit after each task or logical group

- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently

- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
